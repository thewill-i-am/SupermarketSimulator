This repository contains a Java-based project that simulates a supermarket using data structures like queues and stacks. The simulation mimics the behavior of customers and cashiers in a supermarket, and provides real-time feedback on queue lengths and waiting times. The project has been designed using object-oriented programming principles and follows a clean code structure. The codebase includes implementations of queues and stacks, as well as various other data structures commonly used in supermarkets. This repository is intended to serve as a reference point for anyone looking to learn about data structures and algorithms in Java, and also as a proof of concept for building simulations of complex systems using simple data structures.
